I'm thinking that for each exchange we can have 2 files. The first 'scannerPoloniex.js' will be run 24/7 and will..
    - periodically receive the 'pairsPoloniex.json' file
    - cycle through the pairs list
    - receive ticker data
    - convert to consistent format
    - save to storage

This way, if something happens which causes our program to break, it will only affect one exchange. Or if we need to update, we just need to stop collecting on one exchange at a time. And we can always update the pairs we're following without interrupting the scanner.

This will be what I'll be working on for now. I'll create an Archives/ directory and store the old scanner.js and pairs.js there for reference.

Poloniex is working now. There might still be some small bugs. I'm gonna hold out a while and improve the Poloniex scanner before trying Binance.
